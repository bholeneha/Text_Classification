### Database

Since the dataset used in this project is unstructured therefore Amazon S3 is more appropriate than a conventional SQL database. 

## Datasets 

- [NIPS Papers Dataset](https://github.com/kapadias/mediumposts/blob/master/natural_language_processing/topic_modeling/data/NIPS%20Papers.zip)
- [Emails Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dipankarsrirag/topic-modelling-on-emails)

We intend to use one or both of these datasets.
